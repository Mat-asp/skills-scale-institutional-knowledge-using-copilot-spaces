# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README gives an overview of how OctoAcme manages projects and provides quick links to essential project management process documentation.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme's methodology emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, clear roles, and tight feedback loops. Workflows move from project initiation, through planning, execution, risk management, release, and continuous improvement. Documentation ensures all team members have clear guidance and traceable decision records at every stage.

### Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

### Principles
- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-driven decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety**: encourage feedback and learning.

### Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, and communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers**: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing**: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders**: provide inputs and approvals.

### Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Project Lifecycle
- **Initiation**: Define problem, stakeholders, success metrics, and go/no-go.
- **Planning**: Break work into increments, estimate, identify dependencies, and create a delivery plan.
- **Execution**: Use project boards, run standups and demos, apply QA practices, escalate blockers, and measure delivery.
- **Risk & Communication**: Actively manage risks and maintain a risk register. Use regular stakeholder updates and incident communication templates.
- **Release & Deployment**: Ensure readiness with checklists, rollbacks, and clear release notes.
- **Retrospective & Improvement**: Schedule retros, track action items, and celebrate learning.

### Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM and PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
