# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Engineering Lead: provides technical guidance, aligns architecture, and escalates technical risks.
- Developers: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- UX Designer: shapes user experience through design, prototyping, and usability validation.
- DevOps/SRE: manages CI/CD pipelines, system reliability, and incident response.
- Business Analyst: documents requirements, bridges stakeholders and delivery, supports UAT.
- QA/Testing: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- Support Lead: channels customer feedback and post-launch issues into the project process.
- Stakeholders: provide inputs and approvals.

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Daily standups for delivery team (developers, Engineering Lead, QA, DevOps/SRE)
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM + Engineering Lead
- Weekly support summary shared by Support Lead to PM/PdM
- Bi-weekly design review with UX Designer, PdM, and developers
- Monthly stakeholder updates (facilitated by PM with input from Business Analyst)
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
